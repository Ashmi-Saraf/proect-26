1. First rinse and shred or chop all the veggies, then set aside. You will need 1 cup shredded cabbage, ½ shredded carrots, 8 to 10 french beans (thinly sliced or finely chopped), ⅓ sliced capsicum and ⅓ cup chopped spring onion whites. Increase the quantity of veggies according to your preferences. Add some cremini or button mushrooms if you like.
2. Next heat 5 to 6 cups of water in a pan.
3. Then when the water comes to a boil, add ½ teaspoon salt.
4. Next add ½ teaspoon oil and mix well. Add any neutral oil.
5. Then add the noodles (about 200 grams). I have used whole wheat noodles. The recipe is customizable with any noodles – instant, ramen, soba, chow mein, udon, rice. Cook the noodles you will be using according to the package instructions as every variety of noodle will have a different cooking time.
6. Now boil until the noodles are cooked al dente.
7. Be sure to check the doneness throughout the noodles recipe by pressing a few noodles or tasting them. They should be softened, but still have a slight bite to them.
8. Then drain the cooked noodles in a colander or sieve.
9. Next rinse the noodles with fresh water.
10. After that, set aside. You can even toss the noodles recipe with 2 to 3 teaspoons oil if desired.
